# init.lua

This is my [neovim](https://neovim.io) config.
Currently, it is based off of [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org), with a few customizations.
Namely, a few things to get my setup closer to my previous Intellij setup, which is what I'm used to.

Feel free to open issues or pull requests.
I may or may not action on issues and pull requests, though, as this is mainly to make transfer of my config super easy.
