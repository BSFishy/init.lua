# init.lua

This repository houses my current nvim config. Previously, I used lazyvim
directly. I still wanted a bunch of the stuff that I liked but I also wanted to
trim a lot of the fat and simplify things a fair bit. Some notable changes:

- No completion plugin. Still use language servers but no autocomplete
- No formatting. I will manage formatting as I write code and will use command
  line formatters as needed. This includes auto-closing parenthesis, quotes,
  etc.
- Simplified UI. No bufferline, no statusline (subject to change), etc.
